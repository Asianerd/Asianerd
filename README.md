# *Greetings, fellow visitor*


### _As you can see, this seems to be a barren wasteland; Usually incredibly occupied, my history is devoid of any commits, prs and code reviews :|_
<br/>

- I'm a game and console application developer
- Pretty confident in my Linq and listComp skills
- _might use CamelCase in python by accident_
- _might also forget to abide lowerCamel sometimes_
- **I HATE NETWORKING**
